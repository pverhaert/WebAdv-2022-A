# Exam

## Start your exam

- Run `npm install`
- Start the SASS compiler and browser-sync with the command `gulp` or `npm run watch`

## Upload exam to Canvas (on June 10th, 2022 = when your exam is finished!)

- Open _gulpfile.js_
- Replace, on line 2, the value for the variable `name` with your class, surname and name: e.g. `Doe_John_1ITF_01`
- Run the command `gulp zip` or `npm run zip`
  (a file _Doe_John_1ITF_01.zip_ is created at the root of your project)
- **Check if this _.zip_-file contains all the (non-hidden) files from this project, except the _node_modules_ folder!**
- Upload the file _Doe_John_1ITF_01.zip_ to Canvas

## IMPORTANT
- Do not wait until the last few minutes to create the ZIP file because there is a chance that you will 
not be able to upload your exam on time!
